# Automatic Room Assignment Feature

## ✅ **Feature Overview**

When a landlord approves a room application, the tenant is automatically assigned to that room with a complete lease setup.

## 🔄 **Automatic Assignment Process**

### **When Landlord Clicks "Approve":**

1. **⚠️ Enhanced Confirmation Dialog:**

   ```
   Are you sure you want to approve this application?

   ⚠️ This will automatically:
   • Assign [Tenant Name] to [Room Title]
   • Mark the room as occupied
   • Create a 1-year lease starting today
   ```

2. **🏠 Room Status Update:**

   - Room status changes from `"vacant"` → `"occupied"`
   - Room gets tenant information attached
   - Lease dates are set (1 year from approval date)

3. **👤 Tenant Assignment:**

   - Tenant user record updated with room assignment
   - Tenant status set to `"active"`
   - Lease details added to tenant profile

4. **✅ Success Feedback:**

   ```
   ✅ Application Approved!

   [Tenant Name] has been automatically assigned to [Room Title].

   The room is now marked as occupied and a 1-year lease has been created.
   ```

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Updated Functions:**

#### **`updateApplicationStatus()` in `notificationHelpers.js`:**

- ✅ **Enhanced with room assignment logic**
- ✅ **Returns detailed result object**
- ✅ **Handles errors gracefully**
- ✅ **Automatic lease creation (1 year)**

#### **Room Assignment Process:**

```javascript
// 1. Update room status
await updateRoom(room.id, {
  status: "occupied",
  tenant: { id, name, email, phone },
  tenantId: tenant.id,
  occupiedDate: new Date(),
  leaseStart: new Date(),
  leaseEnd: new Date(+1 year)
});

// 2. Update tenant record
await assignTenantToRoom(tenant.id, room.roomNumber, {
  leaseStart: new Date(),
  leaseEnd: new Date(+1 year),
  propertyId: room.property.id,
  roomId: room.id
});
```

### **Data Flow:**

```
Application Approval → Room Assignment → Tenant Update → UI Feedback
```

## 📊 **What Gets Updated**

### **Room Record:**

```javascript
{
  status: "occupied",           // ← Changed from "vacant"
  tenant: {                     // ← Added tenant info
    id: "user_123",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "+63 912 345 6789"
  },
  tenantId: "user_123",         // ← Added reference
  occupiedDate: "2024-01-15T...",// ← Added timestamp
  leaseStart: "2024-01-15T...", // ← Added lease start
  leaseEnd: "2025-01-15T..."    // ← Added lease end
}
```

### **Tenant Record:**

```javascript
{
  roomNumber: "A-101",          // ← Added room assignment
  status: "active",             // ← Changed to active
  leaseStart: "2024-01-15T...", // ← Added lease details
  leaseEnd: "2025-01-15T...",
  propertyId: "prop_123",       // ← Added property link

  assignedAt: "2024-01-15T...", // ← Added assignment timestamp
  balance: 0                    // ← Reset balance
}
```
