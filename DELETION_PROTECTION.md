# Deletion Protection for Occupied Properties and Rooms

## 🛡️ **Feature Overview**

Landlords are now prevented from deleting properties or rooms that have active tenants, ensuring data integrity and preventing accidental loss of important rental information.

## 🚫 **Protection Rules**

### **Property Deletion Protection:**

- ❌ **Cannot delete** properties with any occupied rooms
- ✅ **Can delete** properties with only vacant/maintenance rooms
- 🔍 **Pre-check validation** before showing confirmation dialog
- 📊 **Shows occupancy details** in error messages

### **Room Deletion Protection:**

- ❌ **Cannot delete** rooms with "occupied" status
- ✅ **Can delete** vacant or maintenance rooms
- 👤 **Shows tenant name** in error messages
- 🔍 **Real-time status check** before deletion

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Property Deletion (`utils/propertyHelpers.js`):**

```javascript
export const deleteProperty = async (propertyId) => {
  // Check if property has any occupied rooms
  const { getPropertyRooms } = await import("./roomHelpers");
  const rooms = await getPropertyRooms(propertyId);

  const occupiedRooms = rooms.filter((room) => room.status === "occupied");

  if (occupiedRooms.length > 0) {
    const tenantNames = occupiedRooms
      .map((room) => room.tenant?.name || "Unknown Tenant")
      .join(", ");

    throw new Error(
      `Cannot delete property. ${occupiedRooms.length} room(s) are currently occupied by: ${tenantNames}. Please move out all tenants before deleting the property.`
    );
  }

  // Proceed with deletion if no occupied rooms
  await deleteDoc(propertyRef);
};
```

### **Room Deletion (`utils/roomHelpers.js`):**

```javascript
export const deleteRoom = async (roomId, propertyId) => {
  // Check if room is currently occupied
  const roomRef = doc(db, "rooms", roomId);
  const roomSnap = await getDoc(roomRef);

  if (roomSnap.exists()) {
    const roomData = roomSnap.data();

    if (roomData.status === "occupied") {
      const tenantName = roomData.tenant?.name || "Unknown Tenant";
      throw new Error(
        `Cannot delete room ${
          roomData.number || roomData.title
        }. It is currently occupied by ${tenantName}. Please move out the tenant before deleting the room.`
      );
    }
  }

  // Proceed with deletion if room is not occupied
  await deleteDoc(roomRef);
};
```

"Gateway Apartments" cannot be deleted because it has 2 occupied room(s).
Please move out all tenants before deleting the property.

[OK]
```

#### **Vacant Property Confirmation:**

## 🔍 **Validation Logic**

### **Property Validation:**

1. **Fetch all rooms** for the property
2. **Filter occupied rooms** (status === "occupied")
3. **Count occupied rooms** and extract tenant names
4. **Block deletion** if any rooms are occupied
5. **Show helpful error** with tenant details

### **Room Validation:**

1. **Fetch room data** from Firestore
2. **Check room status** (occupied/vacant/maintenance)
3. **Block deletion** if status is "occupied"
4. **Show helpful error** with tenant name
5. **Allow deletion** for vacant/maintenance rooms
